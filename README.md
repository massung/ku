# Ku - an RSS Aggregator in Scala

Ku is built using the following libraries:

* ScalaFX
* Monix
* ROME
* Joda
* JSoup

It's an attempt to make a "programmer" RSS reader. It's getting close to what I would consider "done" for myself. Once it's a little further along I'll type up some nice documentation on how it's put together and what I like/dislike.
